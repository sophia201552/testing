	{
		ZoneAirTempSettingTooCold = Low Zone Air Temp Setting|Zone air temp setting is too cold for occupants, please check your settings
		ZoneAirTempSettingTooHot = High Zone Air Temp Setting|Zone air temp setting is too hot for occupants, please check your settings
		ZoneAirTempTooCold = Low Zone Air Temp|Zone air temp is colder than its setting, please check your VAV box control
		ZoneAirTempTooHot = High Zone Air Temp|Zone air temp is warmmer than its setting, please check your VAV box control
		ZoneDamperRatioTooBig = Abnormal Big Damper Opening|Zone air temp is cold and VAV box damper stays big, please check your damper and its control logic
		ZoneDamperRatioTooSmall =Abnormal Small Damper Opening|Zone air temp is cold and VAV box damper stays Small, please check your damper and its control logic

    { 
		RATempSettingFault = Undesirable Return Air Temp Setting|Zone air return air temp may be set too cold or warm
		RACO2SettingFault = Undesirable CO2 Setting|Please check your CO2 setting, or indoor air quality may be not desired for occupants
		OASensorFault = OA Sensor Fault|OA sensor readings may not be correct, please check this sensor 
		RASensorFault = RA Sensor Fault|RA sensor readings may not be correct, please check this sensor 
		MASensorFault = MA Sensor Fault|MA sensor readings may not be correct, please check this sensor 
		SASensorFault = SA Sensor Fault|SA sensor readings may not be correct, please check this sensor 
		CWTempFault = CHW Supply Temp Fault|CHW Supply Temp is not desired, please check if chiller plant has any faults on this
		HWTempFault = HW Supply Temp Fault|HW Supply Temp is not desired, please check if hot water system has any faults on this
		CCDamperLeaking = Cooling Coil Valve Leaking|Cooling coil still cools down supply air temperature when cooling coil valve is fully closed
		CCDamperControlFault = Cooling coil control fault| Cooling coil valve can not control related temperature to its setpoints, please check coil controller
		CCCapacityFault = Cooling coil capacity fault|Cooling coil has achieved its maximum outputs while supply air temperature still not cools enough
		HCDamperLeaking = Heating Coil Valve Leaking|Heating coil still heats up supply air temperature when heating coil valve is fully closed
		HCDamperControlFault = Heating coil control fault| Heating coil valve can not control related temperature to its setpoints, please check coil controller
		HCCapacityFault = Heating coil capacity fault|Heating coil has achieved its maximum outputs while supply air temperature still not warm enough
		OADamperRatioTooBig = OA Damper Ratio Too Big|OA damper has an abnormal big openning ratio and brings in too much fresh air flow, leading to energy wasting, Please check your control logic
		OADamperRatioTooSmall = OA Damper Ratio Too Small|OA damper has an abnormal small openning ratio and not bring enough fresh air flow, Please check your control logic
		OADamperRatioStuckSmall = OA Damper Ratio Stuck Small|OA damper has an abnormal small openning ratio and not bring enough fresh air flow, Please check OA damper
		OADamperRatioStuckBig = OA Damper Ratio Stuck Big|OA damper has an abnormal big openning ratio and brings in too much fresh air flow, leading to energy wasting, Please check OA damper
		OADamperRatioNotGoodforVentilation = Small OA Damper Ratio Under free cooling|OADamperRatioNotGoodforVentilation
		FanVSDControlFault = Fan VSD Control Fault| Fan VSD controller may be not well tuned and it may lead to severe energy wasting. Please Check your VSD Controller.

	Chiller
	{
		CondFoulingFault = Condenser Fouling|Condenser may be fouling and it is possible caused by dirty condenser water or bad maintenaince
		EvpFoulingFault = Evaporator Fouling|Evaporator may be fouling and it is possible caused by dirty condenser water or bad maintenaince
		LowLoadFault = Inefficient Low Load Operation | Chiller operating under this condition may lead to additional energy waste.
		HighCondTempFault = High Condenser Temp Fault|This is possible caused by Low Condenser Flow or inefficient operation of cooling towers.
